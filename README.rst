"A Model of Sleep, Leisure and Work over the Business Cycle"


Abstract
========
This paper uses a single-sector dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model to analyze time use patterns over the business cycle. Using ATUS data, we solve and simulate a model of a utility maximizing consumer subject to a penalty function based on a biological model for sleep. We find that sleep is countercyclical with the business cycle: sleep increases as economic activity declines. We also show that our model provides a reasonable estimate of observed sleep behavior over the period from 2003 through 2016. We find that the opportunity cost of sleep over this period is approximately $17 per hour.
